# Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my PGP in AI & ML from Great Learning. It focuses on face detection and recognition using computer vision techniques. The project applies OpenCV, Face-Recognition API, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for feature extraction, followed by model training and evaluation.

# Key Objectives
  * Perform image preprocessing and feature extraction
  * Apply PCA for dimensionality reduction on image data
  * Implement Face Detection using OpenCV
  * Train and evaluate face recognition models
  * Visualize face embeddings and classification results

# Tools & Libraries Used
  * Python (Jupyter Notebook)
  * OpenCV (Image Processing & Face Detection)
  * Face-Recognition API (Face Encoding & Comparison)
  * Scikit-Learn (PCA & Model Training)
  * Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
  * NumPy, Pandas (Data Handling)

# Analysis Performed
  * Data Preprocessing
     - Loading images as NumPy arrays
     - Normalizing pixel values
     - Splitting dataset into training & testing
  * Feature Extraction
     - Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract meaningful features
  * Face Detection & Recognition
     - Detecting faces using OpenCV’s Haar cascades & Dlib
     - Encoding faces using the Face-Recognition API
     - Matching detected faces with stored embeddings
  * Model Training & Evaluation
     - Training classification models for face recognition
     - Evaluating using accuracy, precision, recall
  * Visualization & Insights
     - Displaying detected faces with bounding boxes
     - Plotting PCA-reduced face embeddings
